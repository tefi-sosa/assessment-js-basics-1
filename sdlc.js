// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// 1 - Planning
// 2 - Analysis of Requirements
// 3 - Design
// 4 - Implementation
// 5 - Testing & Integration
// 6 - Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step, developers identify the overall requirements of the client  "

const design = "This step involves creating the architecture of the project."

const implementation = "This is where the finished code is implemented into software and deployed or delivered to clients for use."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the stage where the software is assesed for errors and document bugs if there are any."

const maintain = "This is the step where the software is mantained and upgraded time to time to adapt to changes. It may include handling residual ugs that could not be fixed prior to release or new issues reported by users."
